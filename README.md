# Data-Visualization

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a Loan Data from Prosper dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization,  produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in  Loan Data from Prospe dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
